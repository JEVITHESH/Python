Write a Python function that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

def count_vowels(input_string):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    count = 0
    for char in input_string:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
input_string = "Hello, how are you? Are you doing well?"
print(count_vowels(input_string))
